<h1>Why that book and not another?</h1>
<p>
  This book can be considered as a mentor who will help you to learn any language from scratch. It will guide through all the process
  by keeping you away from the bullshit and giving you only real experiences. It is interesting to learn a language but it is more
  interesting to enjoy learning a language. Furthermore, this book emphasizes on the relatioship between culture and language. It will
  give you another point of view on what is a language and why learning a language to just add a line on your CV is not respectful
  and does not give you value. This book want to help people learn your language as you would like them to learn it and it will help you
  to learn a language as the locals would like you to learn it. Finally, what's is more important in this project is that it shows us that
  there is no shortcuts, you need to experience and enjoy the process to fully understand and use this tool of communication.
