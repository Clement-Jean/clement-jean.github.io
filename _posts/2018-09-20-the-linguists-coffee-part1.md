## Meaning

For this article, I will choose the following meaning: to die (in the word 死亡). I know this isn't a joyful topic but it will introduce
the next character of the series (盲).

## The story

**Now, let's see the how to write it by using a little story.**

Someone died, now some people put his/her body in a coffin and burry the coffin. After a while, some grass is growing on the grave.

**It's as simple as that, but now let's see how it's represented on the character.**

The radical here is 亠. It is representing the ground with a sprout, can you see it ? Then the 𠃊 actually represents a hole in the ground.

## Conclusion

That was a pretty short story, the goal of the series is not to provide really complex one but more to help you to be able to remember the strokes
and help you to write it. Finally, you will see that some characters really introduce some parts of the chinese culture.

**If you have ideas or feedback on that series, please contact me by email (contact page) or by leaving a commentary under the article. Thank you for reading!**
