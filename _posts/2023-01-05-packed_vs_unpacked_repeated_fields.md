title: Packed vs Unpacked Repeated Fields
categories: [Protocol Buffers]

As this is a common and not well documented mistake that developers are doing, I decided to do a post explaining the problem that you might face when using repeated fields in your Protobuf messages.

Be sure to open any refresher section if you feel like you are not sure about a topic. We are going to use them during this post.

<p>
<details><summary><b>Refresher #1: Repeated Fields</b></summary>
<p>A repeated field is a field that can contain 0 or more values. In other words, this is a list. We can create such a field by simply adding a `repeated` modifier in front of the field. This looks like this:</p>
<p>
{% highlight proto %}
repeated int32 ids = 1;
{% endhighlight %}
</p>
</details>
</p>

<p>
<details><summary><b>Refresher #2: Field Options</b></summary>
<p>A field option is some additional information that will be affecting the compilation and thus the code generation. These options can be defined as key value pairs between square brackets between the field tag and the semicolon. In this post we are going to use the <code>packed</code> option, which takes a boolean as value and can only be used on repeated field. This looks like this:</p>
<p>
{% highlight proto %}
repeated int32 ids = 1 [packed = false];
{% endhighlight %}
</p>
</details>
</p>

<p>
<details><summary><b>Refresher #3: Protobuf Text Format</b></summary>
<p>Protobuf does not exclusively encode to binary. It is possible to encode to JSON or to a format that is close to JSON. This text format is generally used for improving readability/writeability (nobody want to read/write binary) and enhance your debugging or analysis of your messages. I will not go into too much details about this here, but to write a repeated field, you can simply repeated the field name as many times as you want to add value to the field, followed by a colon and the value. This looks like this:</p>
<p>
{% highlight yaml %}
ids: 1
ids: 2
ids: 3
{% endhighlight %}
</p>
</details>
</p>

</p>

## Packed

Let's start with packed repeated fields. In order to see how they are encoded we are going to use `protoc --encode` and pass it the content of some file defining the values in Protobuf Text Format. In this text file, let's define 3 values:

```yaml repeated.txt codeCopyEnabled
ids: 1
ids: 2
ids: 3
```

Then, for our proto file, we are going to store these values in a message called `PackedRepeated` that has a field of type `repeated int32`.

```proto repeated.proto codeCopyEnabled
syntax = "proto3";

message PackedRepeated {
  repeated int32 ids = 1;
}
```

And finally, we need to use the `--encode` flag from protoc, which let us take some binary content on the standard input and write some protobuf encoded message on the standard ouput. To take advantage of this we are going to display the content of a file on the standard output, pipe that to the standard input of protoc and finally, pipe the standard ouput of protoc to a command that display an hexadecimal dump.

```shell Linux/MacOS
$ cat repeated.txt | protoc --encode=PackedRepeated proto/repeated.proto | hexdump -C
00000000  0a 03 01 02 03                                    |.....|
00000005
```

```shell Windows (Powershell)
$ (Get-Content ./repeated.txt | protoc --encode=PackedRepeated proto/repeated.proto) -join "`n" | Format-Hex
   Label: /Users/clement/Git/experiment/out.bin

          Offset Bytes                                           Ascii
                 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
          ------ ----------------------------------------------- -----
0000000000000000 0A 03 01 02 03                                  �����
```

So here we can see that the end result of encoding `repeated.txt` content as `PackedRepeated` is `0A 03 01 02 03`. What does that mean? Let's decrypt that.

To do that, we can simply take each hexadecimal number and transform it into binary. While this is pretty simple numbers, let's use the command line to make sure we don't slip up and have wrong binary.

```shell Linux/MacOS
$ echo "ibase=16; obase=2; 0A" | bc
1010

$ echo "ibase=16; obase=2; 03" | bc
11

$ echo "ibase=16; obase=2; 01" | bc
1

$ echo "ibase=16; obase=2; 02" | bc
10
```

```shell Windows (Powershell)
$ [Convert]::ToString(0x0A, 2)
1010

$ [Convert]::ToString(0x03, 2)
11

$ [Convert]::ToString(0x01, 2)
1

$ [Convert]::ToString(0x02, 2)
10
```

> Note: When you are using integer that are not fixed, you are dealing with varints. This means that the bigger the value, the bigger the amount of bytes it will be encoded to. In our example, we purposely chose small numbers so that they are encoded into 1 byte. The following encoding explanation is not correct for all numbers you might use.

- `0A` gives us `1010`. This is a byte that represent both the wire type (type of value) and the field tag. To get the wire type, we simply take the first 3 bits starting from the right. In our case this is `010` or 2. if you check the [Encoding](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#structure) page of Protobuf Documentation, this means that we have a Length-Delimited type. In other words, we have some kind of data that has a dynamic size. This is exactly what we have, this is a list. Then, we are left with a tag equal to 1.
- `03` gives us `11`. This is the actual length of the list. Here we have 3 values.
- `01`, `02` and `03` (we omitted it, because we know the result), gives us respectively `1`, `10` and `11`. These are the actual values that we added into the list.

In the end, we have 5 bytes, 1 byte for type + tag, 1 byte for the list length, and 3 bytes for the values. Pretty compact.

## Unpacked

Let's now see how the same values are encoded in an unpacked repeated field. To do that, we are going to use the `packed` field option. We are going to set that to false so that protoc skip the packing.

```proto repeated.proto codeCopyEnabled
message UnpackedRepeated {
  repeated int32 ids = 1 [packed = false];
}
```

With that done, we can now run similar commands as what we did in the `Packed` section. The only difference is that, now, we need to specify that we want to encode the data as `UnpackedRepeated`.

```shell Linux/MacOS
$ cat repeated.txt | protoc --encode=UnpackedRepeated proto/repeated.proto | hexdump -C
00000000  08 01 08 02 08 03                                 |......|
00000006
```
```shell Windows (Powershell)
$ (Get-Content ./repeated.txt | protoc --encode=UnpackedRepeated proto/repeated.proto) -join "`n" | Format-Hex
   Label: String (System.String) <01DCACCB>

          Offset Bytes                                           Ascii
                 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
          ------ ----------------------------------------------- -----
0000000000000000 08 01 08 02 08 03                               ������
```

And ... We have 6 bytes.

There are two things we can notice here. The first is that now we don't have any `0A` byte. And the second one is that we are interleaving `08` with our values. Let's find out how this was encoded.

As we already know the values for `01`, `02` and `03`, we can just convert `08`.

```shell Linux/MacOS
$ echo "ibase=16; obase=2; 08" | bc
1000
```
```shell Windows (Powershell)
$ [Convert]::ToString(0x08, 2)
1000
```

- `08` gives us `1000`. Once again this is the combination of wire type and field tag. So we have 0 for the wire type, which correspond to varint. And then the field tag is 1.

So in this case, we are basically encoding each value of the list as a separate field. Protobuf will then see that the `ids` field is repeated and that we are adding multiple values with the same field tag and it will just add these values to the list.

In the end, Protobuf is encoding `UnpackedRepeated` into 6 bytes instead of 5. This sounds negligible here because we have a simple example but if you run the example on 100 ids:

> You can generate the repeated.txt by running this in your shell:
> ```shell Linux/MacOS codeCopyEnabled
> for i in {1..100}
> do
>   echo "ids: ${i}" >> repeated.txt
> done
> ```
> ```shell Windows (Powershell) codeCopyEnabled
> foreach ($i in 1..100) {
>   Add-Content -Path "repeated1.txt" -Value "ids: $i"
> }
> ```

```shell Linux/MacOS
$ cat repeated.txt | protoc --encode=PackedRepeated proto/repeated.proto | hexdump -C

```

you will get 102 bytes with the packed version and 200 with the unpacked one. Ouch!

## I'll never use `packed = false`, so what's the problem?

As of now, we were using an example that would probably never appear in real life. So now, it's time to get back in touch with reality. Let's say that instead of storing as `int32` you want to store your ids as strings. To test that, we can create a Simple message called `Repeated` with a repeated string field.

```proto repeated.proto codeCopyEnabled
message Repeated {
  repeated string ids = 1;
}
```

and change our text file to specify string values.

```yaml repeated.txt codeCopyEnabled
ids: "1"
ids: "2"
ids: "3"
```

After that, we are familiar how to encode that, we can just change the `--encode` flag value to `Repeated`.

```shell Linux/MacOS
$ cat repeated.txt | protoc --encode=Repeated proto/repeated.proto | hexdump -C
00000000  0a 01 31 0a 01 32 0a 01  33                       |..1..2..3|
00000009
```
```shell Windows (Powershell)
$ (Get-Content ./repeated.txt | protoc --encode=Repeated proto/repeated.proto) -join "`n" | Format-Hex

   Label: String (System.String) <7AB0A992>

          Offset Bytes                                           Ascii
                 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
          ------ ----------------------------------------------- -----
0000000000000000 0A 01 31 0A 01 32 0A 01 33                      ��1��2��3
```

Does it look familiar to you? Yes, we are interleaving `0A` (length-delimited type with tag 1) with the values (two bytes, `01` is the length and `31`, `32`, `33` are the ASCII values for `1`, `2`, `3`).

This is basically showing us that, even though repeated fields are packed by default, some types cannot be packed. This is the case for the following types:

- `bytes`
- `string`
- User defined Types (messages)

## Conclusion

The overall idea of this post was to explain that some types are not 'packable' when used in repeated fields. Simple types like varints and other numbers can be packed but more complex types cannot. This can cause performance problems and this can even result in poor performance compared to JSON. So the thing to keep in mind when using repeated field is that we should mostly use it with numbers. For other types, use `repeated` with caution.
