There is trend criticizing everything in schools without especially talking about the good sides. I need to admit I criticized too but now I’m realizing that **instead of presenting only the bad points we should also see the good points and give some solutions**. It’s time to change things, let’s see what school does right.

## Diversity
>“We need diversity of thought in the world to face the new challenges.” — Tim Berners-Lee

The first thing I want to talk about about is the diversity and the fact that schools regroup a lot of people. As you know, this is the system which regroup the most people in term of education. These students are all from different background, race, age, sex, and experience. This mix creates a possibility for everyone to learn from everyone and to become more open-minded. Could you do that while staying at home? You couldn't. It is real strength and It would be a pity to remove that during the process of education.

Then, when you have a lot of people around you it teaches you how to interact with people, how to listen to them and you start to realize that some students are better than you on some points and that you are better on others. You’ll then tend to collaborate. **Diversity is the main trigger of collaboration and interaction**.

## Human interaction
>“For good ideas and true innovation, you need human interaction, conflict, argument, debate.” — Margaret Heffernan

**The more you can interact with other students, the more you’ll get experience from them or simply from the process of interacting with them. It can also be to learn things on you but on others**. From whom you would learn from by staying at your home in front of your computer? With whom would you interact with, without experiencing life during schools? We all lived the time in which we need to go back home just after school, we also sometimes came back home with some friends and talk about some things. Will our child lack of that kind of moment? Social interactions with peers is making students growing and becoming adult.

There is another kind of interaction which can help students. The interaction with teachers. We all have a favorite teacher, someone who influenced us and someone who had our respect. Teachers, at first, are mentors not robot repeating by heart their courses. That interaction can construct a real connection between a student and a student, especially when the students experience the time in which they try to push the limits with their parents. **Everyone needs a mentor in order to improve and so students do**.

## Associations
>“Within each such social group, a feeling of solidarity prevails, a compelling need to work together and a joy in doing so that represent a high moral value.” — Christian Lous Lange

If we still talk about the interactions between students we can discuss about associations in which students can find like-minded people. They can move forward together and maybe discover some new passions. **You could have access to everything on internet if you don’t know what you will search about, you’ll find nothing**. Then, you are generally restricted by the way your parents are thinking, it is a social effect recognized, you tend to think a little bit like your parents and if you don’t experience other things you’ll tend to have the same life. I’m not saying it’s a bad thing but I guess parents want a better life for their children, don’t they ?

The associations will make a mix of these thoughts, it will creates discussion based on different point of views and it will sometimes lead people to consolidate their thoughts or why not changing their mind. Finally, a group of people is stronger than a Man alone. Our history proved it. **By collaborating with people we liked and we trusted we attain the goal of hunting a mammoth, we discovered some medicine against diseases and we are the people holding the future in our hands**.

## Important range of topics
>“Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved.” — Helen Keller

Finally, as I said you could have access to everything if you don’t know it exists you’ll never learn about it. Schools are doing a pretty good job on it even if they start to be a little bit old fashioned. They give you access to music, history, sport, and a lot of other classes even some on new topics. Teachers and school curriculum can lead you to find what you want to do in the future or to give you some hobbies. It’s not negligible when we know that having hobbies and goals are the key to mastery and so to creativity.

Children need to move, do sport and experience new things, it creates intense connections in their brain between knowledges. When they will become adults, this experiences will help them going through problems or even maybe good times. This high range of experience couldn't really be adapted at home because parents need to work and because teachers need to go deep enough on some subjects.

## Conclusion
The current system is maybe not efficient on some points and sometimes old fashioned but we still need to acknowledge the good sides. Schools give you a good environment, good interactions and finally a lot of experiences. Maybe we should improve the current system instead of starting from scratch, I think it could give interesting results.
