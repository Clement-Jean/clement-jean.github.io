> “Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience.” — Paulo Coelho

If you ever hesitated between working for a better salary or a better experience, **there is a possibility you did the wrong choice by choosing the better salary**. Our projects are important in our life and it influences who we are but also some aspects of our life. Let’s see why we did some wrong choices and why working for experience and not for money is the best option you’ll have in your life.

## Background
Before to talk about you about what working on something you like will bring you, I want to talk to you about an error I made. That error is actually stupid and I’m a little bit ashamed to express that but it made me learn something interesting: **Money is not everything**. Yes it helps to have money but what matters most is the experience related with it. Did you gain money by doing something you like or by doing something you are sick of? That’s what is important.

One of my friend wanted to do few extra hours after her daily job to teach English to a group a Japanese people. When she described me the job I was seeing it as a good opportunity for her to make more money so I asked her: “What’s the salary ?”, she answered something like 180 yuans per hour (28 $ per hour). As I had a little bit of experience in teaching English in China, I told her that this salary is really low. However, what I didn't asked to her is what is the experience you’ll gain if you do this job.

After few weeks, we discussed again about teaching and we arrived at the conclusion that **what is better for people is to have the experience more than the money because you can spend the money but you will always keep the experience**. So, after a time thinking about my error I told here: “Wait, I’m sorry about what I said and it was an awful advice, you need to do this teaching job”. She applied for it and now guess what, she’s teacher and she enjoys it. I learned such an important lesson, I’m so proud of it and that’s why I want to share it with you.

## Happiness
> “Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.” — Confucius

We all felt some moment in our life in which the time is flying because we are doing something that we so interested about that we don’t think about anything else. Being interested in your project will lead you to happiness because you will not see time passing.

At the opposite, involve yourself in a project you don’t like and you’ll feel like your life is not valuable, you’ll even think you are not valuable. The problem is that, at that moment, you are lying to yourself. **You are valuable, you deserve to do something you really like because it will give you more skills**.

You relations with yourself but also with other people will be greatly improved if you work for an idea you consider as important, as possibly giving new opportunities for you or as simply interesting. **Everything in your life will become easier, the problems you will encounter will be easier to manage and finally you’ll move forward and get out of your comfort zone more easily**.

## Learning
> “Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.” — Benjamin Franklin

The second thing it will bring you is the possibility to learn more. As I explained in the happiness part you’ll involve yourself more in an interesting project. **It will create a permanent state of interest and curiosity in what you are doing**. You’ll search for new ways to do things better or new skills you can acquire.

You’ll learn as you never learned before. You’ll get out the boring and the state of stagnation created by your comfort zone. This is when you’ll start to have new ideas and sometimes new innovative ones. It will make you experience a state of continuous improvement, you’ll like it and everyone around will feel it.

Finally, **this is important to work for your own experience more than just for your bank account because your bank account does not define who you are but your experience will**. How do you want to become better if your focus is to put more and more money in your pocket? It will obsess you, you’ll not read, you’ll not work on what you love and you’ll maybe avoid to talk to some people.

## Conclusion

**We need to keep in mind that the best things in life are free, or at least money is not everything**. Prefer to work on what matters for you than working on what pays more because sometimes it will lead you to sadness and stagnation. Get out of you comfort zone, follow what you are interested in and it will make your life happier, easier and every aspect of your life will be affected positively.
