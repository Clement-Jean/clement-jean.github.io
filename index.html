More precisely, we are going to lex spaces (whitespaces, new lines, ...), comments, Identifiers, Numbers (Int and Float), and Strings. At the end of this article, we will have a fully functioning lexer that can tokenize the descriptor.proto which is the longest proto file in the protobuf repo.

Obviously, this is going to be a series of articles because we need to write quite a lot of parsing code. However, I believe that this is worth doing since we are going to see another use of Protobuf outside of gRPC. </div> <a href="/protein_lexer_part_1/" alt="Protein: Lexer (Part 1)" class="read-more red-black-link">Read More</a> </article> <article class="post"> <h1><a href="/writing_protoc_plugins/">Writing Protoc Plugins</a></h1> <div class="entry"> Recently, I answered a StackOverflow question related to writing protoc plugins and Protobuf custom options.

While this is an important topic, the gRPC doc seems to only mention that the Unimplemented version is for Forward Compatibility, and my course, up until now, uses the name of the generated Service Server directly. As such, I thought I would give an explanation on why I now recommend to use Unimplemented and some examples of the 3 Type Embeddings that you can use. </div> <a href="/grpc_go_embeddings/" alt="gRPC Go Server Embeddings" class="read-more red-black-link">Read More</a> </article> <article class="post"> <h1><a href="/protobuf-varint-vs-fixed/">Protocol Buffers varint vs fixed</a></h1> <div class="entry"> This article is much more a note to myself than something else but this might be interesting for people out there.
